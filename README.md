# Firmware on a Fake GPU 

This project simulates a minimal GPU Command Processor and its
Firmware / Driver / User-space stack.

Goal:
- Practice Firmware & Systems C++ development
- Demonstrate HW/FW/SW boundary handling
- Practice concurrency, MMIO, interrupts, and error recovery

This is NOT:
- A real GPU
- CUDA
- Graphics rendering
